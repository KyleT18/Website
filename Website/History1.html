        <h1><u>Start Of The Franchise (1988-1995)</u></h1>
        <p>Florida was a state without an NBA franchise, so groups from Orlando, Tampa/St. Petersburg and Miami all vied to land franchises. The Miami Sports and Exhibition Authority was eventually endorsed a group led by NBA Hall of Famer Billy Cunningham
          and former sports agent Lewis Schaffel.
          <br> They would received their financial backing from Carnival Cruise Lines founder Ted Arison, who would be majority owner. Day-to-day operations would be handled by minority shareholders Cunningham and Schaffel. In April 1987, the NBA expansion
          committee endorsed the bids of the cities of Charlotte and Minneapolis.
          <br> The committee was split between awarding the third and final franchise to either Miami or Orlando. Finally, they decided that the NBA would expand by 4 teams, with the Charlotte Hornets and Miami Heat debuting for the 1988–89 season and the
          Minnesota Timberwolves and Orlando Magic beginning for the 1989–90 season.
          <br> At the survey for the choice of the name, Miami Heat won against Miami Vice, the famous detective show set in South Beach. The Heat came into the NBA for the 1988–89 season with an unproductive first year, with a roster full of young players
          and journeymen. The team started out the season by losing its first 17 games, including a blowout 138–91, to Magic Johnson's Los Angeles Lakers, at the time an NBA record. The team ultimately finished with a league-worst 15–67 win-loss record
          (tied for worst season in franchise history). To help address Miami's league-low point production, the Heat picked Glen Rice from the University of Michigan in the first round of the 1989 NBA Draft, and Sherman Douglas of Syracuse University
          in the 2nd round. The team also moved to the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference for the 1989–90 season, where they would remain for the next 15 years.
          <br> However, the Heat continued to struggle and never won more than two consecutive games, en route to an 18–64 record. While Rice, Seikaly and Douglas all showed improvement from the previous year, Miami still only went 24–58 and remained in the
          Atlantic Division basement. Rothstein would resign as head coach at the end of the season, but later would return to the Heat prior to the 2004–05 season as an assistant coach, a role he still fulfills today.
          <br> In the wake of Rothstein's resignation prior to the 1991–92 season, the Heat hired Kevin Loughery, who had 29 years of experience in the NBA both as a coach and a player, to be their new head coach. For the 1991 NBA Draft, the team selected
          Steve Smith from Michigan State, an agile guard, to usher in a new era of a mature Heat team. With the help of rookie Smith, Rony Seikaly, and a more experienced Glen Rice, the Heat finished in fourth place in the Atlantic Division with a 38–44
          record even with a shocking defeat against the Cleveland Cavaliers 148–80 and made the playoffs for the first time in their history, becoming the first of the four late 80's expansion teams to do so.
          <br> Playing the league-best Chicago Bulls, the Heat were swept in three games. Steve Smith made the NBA All-Rookie team and Glen Rice finished 10th in the NBA in scoring. </p>

        </center>

        <p>The 1992-93 NBA season included the additions of draft choice Harold Miner of the University of Southern California as well as trading a 1st round pick (which would turn into the No. 10 overall pick the following season) for Detroit Pistons forward/center
          John Salley. While Salley's addition was first met with hope because of the role that he played on two championship Pistons squads, it became quickly apparent that Salley was a quality role player for a good team, but not a quality player for
          a mediocre team like Miami was at the time. Salley would eventually have his playing time diminish, ultimately resulting in his being taken by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 expansion draft.
          <br> As for the season itself, it started off poorly, with Smith missing time with a knee injury and Burton being lost for most of the year with a wrist injury. Upon Smith's return, Miami posted a winning record in February and March, but it was
          not enough to dig themselves out of the 13–27 hole they began in. They finished 36–46 and would not return to the playoffs. A healthier squad fared better in 1993–94, posting the franchise's first-ever winning record at 42–40 and returning to
          the playoffs as the No. 8 seed versus the Atlanta Hawks. After Miami had a 2–1 series lead, Atlanta rallied from the deficit to win the best-of-5 series. After that season, Steve Smith would be selected as a member of the 2nd Dream Team, the
          collection of NBA All-Stars who were selected to compete in the 1994 FIBA World Championship in Toronto as Team USA. Dream Team II, also made up of future Heat players Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning, Dan Majerle and Tim Hardaway, would go
          on to win the tournament.
          <br> In 1994–95, the team unexpectedly overhauled their roster, trading away Seikaly, Smith and Grant Long in exchange for Kevin Willis and Billy Owens. It was a widely unpopular decision, as the Miami community had grown to love Smith, Long and
          Seikaly when they were with the Heat, and the owners' sudden decision to trade them away left a bitter taste in the mouths of the fans, especially since Willis and Owens were busts.
