<h1><u>Back To Back Champions (2012-2013)</u></h1>
<p>After the second NBA Lockout ended, the Heat would improve their roster by signing veteran Shane Battier. In the shortened 2011–12 season, the Heat got off to a 27–7 start, and for the second year in a row, James, Wade and Bosh were selected to the NBA All-Star Game. However, they would struggle for the second half of the season going 19–13. The Heat finished 46–20, earning the second seed in the east for the NBA Playoffs. Entering the first round, they took a 3-0 lead against the New York Knicks, but like their previous series with the Sixers, weren't able to close them out in Game 4. A victory in Game 5 ultimately defeated New York, and the Heat advanced to the second round versus the Indiana Pacers. <br>
In a Game 1 home victory, Chris Bosh went down with a lower abdominal strain injury, and was proclaimed to miss out on the rest of the Indiana series. After losing Game 2 at home and Game 3 at Indiana, many criticized Dwyane Wade's lackluster performance in Game 3, bringing attention to the fact that he got into a verbal argument with Spoelstra. However, with Wade visiting his former college coach, the team overcame adversity and defeated the Pacers in the next three games, with James and Wade often combining for an average of 70 points to close out the Pacers. <br>
They met the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals, taking the first two games, before losing the next three, including one home loss where Bosh returned from the injury. However, on June 7, they took a big road win at Boston beating the Celtics 98–79 to tie the series 3–3; James had a remarkable 45 points and 15 rebounds.<br>
The deciding Game 7 was at Miami; although the Celtics largely dominated during the first half, the second half saw several lead changes as both teams went back and forth. The Heat eventually won 101–88, reaching the NBA Finals for the second straight year.</p>

<p>In the much anticipated match-up with the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Heat split the first two games, winning Game 2 on the road, before sweeping the next three at home. James was named the Finals MVP as he won his first NBA championship. The Heat became the first NBA team to win the Finals despite trailing in three different series beforehand (1-2 with Indiana, 2-3 with Boston and 0-1 with OKC). <p>
In addition, the Heat once again swept Games 3, 4 and 5 at home (becoming only the third team to do so) on their way to their second championship.
On July 11, 2012, the Heat officially signed veterans Ray Allen to a three-year deal and Rashard Lewis to a two-year deal after releasing Terrel Harris and Josh Harrellson, Miami signed Jarvis Varnado and Chris Andersen for the remainder of the season to bolster the defense. Miami became the third team to field three All-Stars (Wade, James and Bosh) in at least three consecutive seasons; the fourth such occurrence in league history after the 1980s Lakers and Celtics, and the 2008–2011 Celtics.
Along the way, the Heat achieved individual milestones. On November 21, 2012 against Milwaukee, Udonis Haslem became the first un-drafted player to lead a franchise in rebounding, after passing the previous record held by Alonzo Mourning. On January 12, 2013 against Sacramento, Mario Chalmers had a career-high 10-triples, tying Brian Shaw's record for most three pointers in a single game. Four days later against Golden State, LeBron James became the youngest player in NBA history to score 20,000 career-points and made his 5,000 career assist.
On February 3, 2013, the Heat embarked on a winning streak, after winning over the Toronto Raptors. Eight days later against Portland, LeBron James broke Moses Malone and Adrian Dantley's record of six straight 30 point games on 60% shooting. The 117-104 win was also the Heat's 1000th regular season win in franchise history. 
Following consecutive wins against the Memphis Grizzlies and New York Knicks, the Heat tied their franchise record for longest win streak at 14, first set in the 2004–2005 season. A win against the Indiana Pacers extended the streak to 18, marking the first time the Heat has ever defeated all 29 teams in a single season. Dwyane Wade became the first guard since Michael Jordan in 1995-1996 to score 20-plus w/ 50 percent-plus shooting in 11 straight games. Chris Bosh, though averaging a career low in minutes played, was having his most efficient shooting percentage to date, at over 51%. <br>
The winning streak continued on March 18, where they defeated the Boston Celtics five years to the day that the Celtics snapped the Houston Rockets' 22-game win streak, coming back from a 17-point deficit in the game. Two nights later, the Heat overcame a 27-point deficit late in the third quarter to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers and push the streak to 24. Two nights later, the Heat beat the Detroit Pistons and hit the 25 mark. On March 24, the Heat took on the Charlotte Bobcats at home and easily got win number 26. The following night, the Heat went to Amway Center to play the Magic where they chalked up their 27th in a row.
The streak would end on March 27, when the Chicago Bulls would beat the Heat 101 - 97 in Chicago. Nevertheless, in that game against the Bulls, Wade blocked his 50th shot of the season. It was his eighth straight season with 50 or more blocks. The only other guard with that milestone is Michael Jordan. In March 31, with a game-winning 3-point shot by Chris Bosh against the San Antonio Spurs, the Heat became the first team in the NBA to win 17 games in a single month. That win was also the second time the Heat had swept the season series against the Spurs. <br>
A win against the Washington Wizards on April 10 set a new franchise record of 62 wins. They achieved this without the Big 3 playing in the game. On April 14, they exacted revenge against the Bulls with a 105–93 victory, marking a new franchise record of home wins at 36–4. With a game-saving block by Norris Cole. Defeating Orlando at the season finale set the franchise record for 66 wins in a season. By the end of the season, the Heat won 18 of last 19 road games, the best streak on the road to end a season in the history of the NBA. <br>
With a win in Game 7 against the Indiana Pacers, Miami became the first Eastern Conference team to reach the NBA Finals in three straight years since the Chicago Bulls in the late 1990s. The Heat concluded their season with a 66–16 regular season record, the top seed in both the Eastern Conference and the entire league.</p>

<p>Miami lost Game 1 of the Finals on their home floor against the Spurs in a close game that was decided by a last minute buzzer beater by Tony Parker. The Heat went on to win Game 2 with a 33–5 run in the second half and a monstrous block by LeBron James on Tiago Splitter being highlights of the game.</p>

<p>The Spurs responded by defeating the Heat in a 113–77 rout on their home floor in San Antonio, where the Spurs set a record for most 3-pointers made in a single Finals game with 16 made 3's. </p>

<p>The two teams continued to trade wins leading up to Game 6 where the Spurs, up 10 heading in the 4th quarter, were in position to close out the series and win the championship. James went on to score 16 points in the period, outscoring the entire Spurs squad by himself at one point, and put his team back into position to win. The Spurs were up 5 with 28 seconds left in the 4th quarter when James cut it to 2 with a timely 3 pointer. <br>
Thanks to Kawhi Leonard missing a key free throw on the other end, the game remained a one possession game. With 5 seconds left in regulation, Ray Allen hit a 3-pointer to send the game into overtime where Chris Bosh made a game-saving block on Danny Green's 3-point shot attempt, the Heat defeated the Spurs 103–100. The game is considered one of the greatest in Finals history. Some refer to Game 6 as the "No Headband Game" due to James losing his trademark headband before going on his monstrous 4th quarter tear.<br>
The Heat went on to defeat the Spurs 95–88 in Game 7 behind a 37 point and 12 rebound performance from James and a 23-point and 10-rebound effort from Wade. Shane Battier also went off for 18 points behind 6-8 shooting from the 3-point line after having a horrible shooting slump the entire post-season up to that point. The Heat captured the NBA title once again for a second year in a row, becoming the first team in the Eastern Conference to repeat as league champions since the late 1990s Chicago Bulls. <br>
The series is widely considered as a classic. James was named the NBA Finals MVP, becoming the fifth player to win the award back-to-back along with Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kobe Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, and Hakeem Olajuwon and only the second player in NBA history to win the Finals MVP and league MVP back-to-back along with Jordan. Overall, the Miami Heat 2012–13 season is considered one of the most historic runs in NBA history.
