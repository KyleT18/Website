<h1><u>Decline (2000-2003)</u></h1>
<p>After being knocked out of the playoffs by the New York Knicks in the series-deciding game for the third straight season, Pat Riley decided it was time for the Heat to undergo some changes. <br>
After losing out to the Orlando Magic to get Toronto Raptors swingman Tracy McGrady, Miami decided to trade Brown and Mashburn to the Charlotte Hornets (among others) in exchange for Eddie Jones, Anthony Mason and Ricky Davis. Miami also picked up Brian Grant to go along with the core of Mourning, Hardaway, Majerle, Bruce Bowen and Anthony Carter. <br>
That summer, Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway traveled to Sydney, Australia to be part of the second Olympic "dream team" that would eventually win the gold medal, making them the first two Heat players to ever win Olympic gold medals.
Unfortunately, the elation soon turned to fear. On the plane ride home from the Olympics, Mourning noticed that his legs were very badly swollen. Upon getting a physical the next day at the start of training camp, it was discovered that Mourning had a chronic kidney disease: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. On October 16, 2000, it was announced that Alonzo would not play in the 2000–2001 season. <br>
The Heat missed Mourning for 69 games in 2000–01, yet found success with Grant, Jones and Mason, the latter of whom was named to his first All-Star game. Led by Hardaway, the Heat embarked on yet another winning season, with a 50-32 record, earning the 3rd seed in the Eastern Conference. With 13 games remaining, Mourning surprisingly returned to the Heat's lineup on March 27, 2001 against the Toronto Raptors. <br>
He would make the game-winning dunk several weeks later against the Milwaukee Bucks. With their full lineup intact for the first time all year, the Heat were qualifying for the playoffs for the sixth straight season. The Heat met the 6th seeded Charlotte Hornets in the first round, the same team they had traded Mashburn and Brown to the previous summer. Despite having the better regular season record, the Heat were absolutely obliterated by the Hornets. <br>
Charlotte took the first two games in Miami by 26 each, before closing out the series on their home floor by 15. Mourning in particular was a shell of his former, MVP-candidate self. This loss marked the end of the Mourning-Hardaway era that had started 5 years earlier. The Heat would not make the playoffs again for several years. <br>
The following two seasons were two of the worst in Heat history. Pat Riley missed the playoffs for the first time in his coaching career, and much of the remaining core from the division-title winning Heat teams of the late 1990s departed (Tim Hardaway, Bruce Bowen and Dan Majerle). The veteran team narrowly missed the playoffs, despite having a losing record at 36–46.<br>
Miami began to rebuild in 2002–03. They drafted Caron Butler in the first round and Rasual Butler in the second round of the 2002 NBA Draft. Mourning missed the entire season due to his condition worsening and Eddie Jones also missed a huge portion of the season with an ankle injury. The Heat was led by Caron Butler and many of the youthful players that have filled out the Heat's roster and finished 25–57 to end the 2002–2003 season as Riley stepped down as head coach and the team finished 7th in the Atlantic Division.
