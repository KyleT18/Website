<h1><u>Drafting Dwyane Wade/ Trading For Shaquille O'Neal (2003-2005)</u></h1>
<p>Alonzo Mourning's huge contract expired the following summer, giving the Heat some much-needed cap room to rebuild. However, Miami was still a few million dollars away from signing a max contract player. The Heat presented a 6-year $63 million offer sheet to restricted free-agent forward Lamar Odom which the Clippers declined to match. Miami also signed free agent point guard Rafer Alston otherwise known as "Skip-to-my-Lou" during his And 1 basketball fame. <br>
The Heat also opted to draft Dwyane Wade out of Marquette University with the 5th overall pick in the 2003 NBA draft instead of signing a large-scale free agent point guard such as Gilbert Arenas. The pick was somewhat surprising at the time, since it was expected that Miami would draft a true point guard rather than a shooting guard. Miami also signed Udonis Haslem out of the University of Florida, who went undrafted a season earlier. Odom, Alston, Haslem and Wade teamed up with Grant, Jones, Allen and both Butlers formed one of the most surprising teams of the season.</p>

<p>A few days before the start of the 2003–04 season, Riley stepped down as head coach to focus more on his role as team president, and promoted longtime assistant coach Stan Van Gundy to the head coaching position. The team was expected to be among the league's worst by NBA prognosticators. After dealing with early injury problems to Odom, Wade and both Butlers, the team jelled. The Heat's newcomers brought youth and energy to the team. Wade broke several rookie records while other Heat players revived their careers. <br>
Wade led the Heat over the New Orleans Hornets, the same team that had swept the Heat into rebuilding mode three seasons prior. Miami went on to lose to the Indiana Pacers 4–2 in the Conference Semifinals.
After the promising 2003–04 season, Miami took major steps toward becoming a Championship franchise. They acquired superstar center Shaquille O'Neal on July 14, 2004 in a trade with the Los Angeles Lakers for Lamar Odom, Caron Butler and Brian Grant. Riley also tried to sign Karl Malone, but Malone decided to retire instead. Wade and O'Neal worked well as a pair. <br>
The season also reunited several former club members. Ron Rothstein, the Heat's first head coach, became an assistant coach, Steve Smith rejoined the club and Alonzo Mourning was re-signed after being released from the Toronto Raptors in December.
The Heat achieved its third best record in franchise history: 59–23. They also had 14 consecutive victories, which remained a franchise record until the 2012–2013 season. They were seeded first in the playoffs, and swept through the first two rounds against New Jersey and Washington, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals against defending Champion Detroit. <br>
The teams split the first four games before Miami took an 88–76 victory in Game 5, but in the process lost Wade to a strained rib muscle which he suffered in an attempt to take a charge against Pistons forward Rasheed Wallace. With Wade out, the Heat lost 91–66 in Game 6 at Detroit, setting up Game 7 in Miami.<br>

Wade returned to play and the Heat held a six-point lead with three minutes remaining. A series of missed shots and turnovers ensued, that cost the Heat their first ever finals game 7 in an 88–82 loss. Wade appeared to struggle to breathe throughout the game though he scored 20 points.
