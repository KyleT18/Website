<h1><u>New York Knicks Rivarly (1997-2000)</u></h1>
<p>During the offseason, the team's focus shifted to building a new, better arena to replace the Miami Arena. After overcoming political opposition, the organization celebrated their 10-year anniversary as AmericanAirlines Arena broke ground on January 27, 1998. The Heat had another great regular season in 1997-98, ultimately finishing 55-27. Not much had changed from a year earlier heading into the 1998 Playoffs. Once again, the Heat were Atlantic Division Champions. Once again, they were the #2 seed in the East, with the Chicago Bulls, once again, holding the #1 seed. The New York Knicks were the #7 seed, which meant that that the Heat would once again battle with their fiercest rival from the year before.<br>
Only this time, it would be in the first round; a best of five series. The two teams seemed evenly matched, with Miami taking Games 1 and 3 and New York taking Games 2 and 4. The most memorable moment of the series came at the conclusion of Game 4 when an altercation erupted between Alonzo Mourning and Larry Johnson. This is the fight in which Jeff Van Gundy infamously grabbed onto Mourning's leg in an attempt to intervene. More importantly, it resulted in Mourning being suspended for the deciding game of the series. Many Heat fans felt that Johnson, knowing the Knicks had already won Game 4, deliberately provoked Mourning with only a second left on the clock so that he would be suspended for the series-deciding game, in an attempt to not only give the Knicks extra leverage, but to avenge the suspensions from the previous year. </p>

<p>Regardless of his intent, it worked, as the Heat were no match for the Knicks in Game 5 without their all-star captain and defensive centerpiece. New York took the series 3-2, pulling off a first round upset. After Mourning was ejected from Game 4, Riley was seen outside the visitors' room at Madison Square Garden, resting his hands on the wall and hanging his head down, contemplating the loss of Mourning for Game 5.<br>

After a devastating upset loss to the Knicks in the 1998 Playoffs, the Heat immediately geared up for the 1998-99 season. with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson all leaving/retiring from the Chicago Bulls, the Heat were considered major contenders to claim the top spot in the east. However, just a few weeks into the offseason, a massive lockout began, and it became unclear whether there would even be a 1998-99 season.<br>
This was the first work stoppage in NBA history that resulted in missed games. Several months passed and everything remained up in the air. Finally, in January 1999, the National Basketball Association and the National Basketball Players Association reached an agreement on a new collective bargaining agreement. All teams played a shortened 50-game regular season schedule beginning on February 9 with very limited days off. <br>
Despite the grueling schedule, the Heat emphatically lived up to expectations during the 50-game season, claiming the 1st seed in the East just as they were favored to. Alonzo Mourning in particular had a great season, leading the league in blocks and winning Defensive Player of the Year. He was also named as the Center for the All-NBA First Team and was the runner-up for NBA Most Valuable Player, with Karl Malone winning the award. <br>
Had Mourning won MVP over Malone, he would have joined Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon as the only players to win MVP and Defensive Player of the Year in the same season. Miami would have a conference-best 33–17 record to claim their first-ever No. 1 seed in the NBA Playoffs. In the first round, they were once again matched against their rivals, the New York Knicks, who had struggled through the 50-game season and barely slipped into the playoffs with the #8 seed.
During the first four games, the Knicks took Games 1 and 3, and the Heat took Games 2 and 4, the exact opposite of the year before. For the third year in a row, it came down to one final, deciding game at the Miami Arena. The Heat led throughout the entire 4th Quarter and appeared to be closing in on avenging the previous year's loss, but the Knicks managed to cut the deficit to 1. With only a few seconds left in the game, Terry Porter had Latrell Sprewell trapped on the baseline and Miami was on the verge of narrowly escaping. <br>
Porter took a stab at the ball, and it went out of bounds, but the officials declared it was still New York's ball. After Porter had Sprewell trapped with only a few seconds left, the Knicks now had another chance to inbound the ball and attempt a game-winning shot. Charlie Ward inbounded to Allan Houston, who immediately dribbled through a massive gap and put up a floater. The ball bounced off the rim, onto the backboard, back onto the rim, and fell in. The Knicks had pulled off one of the greatest upsets in NBA history, becoming just the second #8 seed to knock off a #1 seed in the playoffs. <br>
For the second year in a row, the Heat were stopped dead in their tracks by the Knicks who would go on to become the first 8 seed to make the NBA Finals.<br>
After three failed attempts at a championship run and two consecutive seasons of first round-heartbreak against the determined Knicks, the Heat looked forward to the 1999–2000 season. Once again, the Heat showed tremendous promise in the regular season, starting off 15-4 while still playing at Miami Arena. On January 2, 2000, the Miami Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first game ever played at AmericanAirlines Arena. The Heat finished 52-30, earning their fourth straight division title and the 2nd seed in the East. Mourning led the league in blocked shots and repeated as Defensive Player of the Year. Mourning and Hardaway brought the Heat to the playoffs for the fifth straight year, but Hardaway suffered an injury that kept him from competing.<br>
In the first round, they met the #7 seeded Detroit Pistons. Even without Tim Hardaway, Miami won the series 3-0, the first sweep in franchise history. This brought the Heat to the Conference Semifinals against the Knicks, battling with New York for the fourth consecutive postseason. <br>
The series began in Miami, with Hardaway returning to the starting lineup, but it was Mourning's 26 points that took a Game 1 victory. The Knicks evened the series with a six-point Game 2 win in Miami. Game 3 was at Madison Square Garden, with the Heat winning in overtime. As the series continued, the Knicks would win Game 4 and the Heat took Game 5, taking a 3-2 series lead.</p>

<p>However, the Knicks won Game 6, forcing a deciding 7th game in Miami. The Heat had control of the game with a minute to go, but Mourning went for a steal on Ewing, when he could have forced a tougher shot; it allowed Ewing to dunk, bringing the Knicks ahead by one. Following a timeout with seven seconds to play, Mourning gave the ball to Mashburn, thinking that Mashburn would make the shot. <br>
However, Mashburn was double-teamed by Ewing and Childs, so he threw it to Clarence Weatherspoon. After dribbling passed his defender, Weatherspoon pulled up for a jump shot, but the ball bounced off the backboard; New York won the game by one point. </p>
